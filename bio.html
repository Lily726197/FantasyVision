                <h1>My Biography</h1>
                <p>I was born at the ProMedica Toledo Hospital on June 19, 2006,
                    along with my twin brother, Luke. We were both diagnosed with
                    autism two years later, which is when we both started to go to
                    preschool at CHiP. We started elementary school at Hill View 
                    Elementary in Sylvania in 2012, attending regular classes along
                    with occupational and speech therapy on certain days during the 
                    week. We moved to Arbor Hills Junior High in 2018 and Northview
                    High School in 2021, where we are currently in our senior year.
